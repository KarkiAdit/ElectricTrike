**1. How would I describe Electric Trike?**
Electric trike is an **environment friendly three-wheeler automobile, a Nepali product made from scratch.** The idea to build it came along with the increasing air pollution in Kathmandu or must say around the world. It is a viable approach, an asset and a step towards making environment green and clean without hindering the transportation luxury. (To my defence, many countries in Europe have started riding bicycles which obviously is a great initiative but doesn't give anyone luxury and obviously is time consuming but healthy.)

**2. What was the fuel for the Trike? Or in other words, how was the Trike operated?**<br />
The Electric Trike was a three-way powered vehicle. It basically ran on three fuels: batteries, solar power and the hydrogen gas.

**3. What was the chemical processes/reactions used to create the fuel for the trike?**
For batteries and solar power, it was only the matter of wiring. Hydrogen gas was a major offset. Industrial production of hydrogen gas is expensive so we thought of an idea to react Sodium hydroxide with aluminium and water which gave us Sodium Aluminate ( it is used as a cloggant toilets maa and many other things and is basic so doesn't harm the environment) and hydrogen gas.

Zinc and copper plates were used as anode and cathode respectively. Balloons were used for the use of hydrogen collection. A piece of platinum (catalyst) was used in the container to boost the reaction between NaOh, H2o and Al. Give proper reaction for them. (google maa paihalxa) The voltmeter was connected to the complete circuit then a small defelction was seen in the voltmeter (0.6V to 0.9V) meaning that the electricity was produced.

The real mechanism is here!!
A fuel cell consists of two electrodes—a negative electrode (or anode) and a positive electrode (or cathode)—sandwiched around an electrolyte. A fuel, such as hydrogen, is fed to the anode, and air is fed to the cathode. In a hydrogen fuel cell, a catalyst at the anode separates hydrogen molecules into protons and electrons, which take different paths to the cathode. The electrons go through an external circuit, creating a flow of electricity. The protons migrate through the electrolyte to the cathode, where they unite with oxygen and the electrons to produce water and heat.
