**1. How would I describe Electric Trike?**<br />
Electric trike is an **environment friendly three-wheeler automobile, a Nepali product made from scratch.** The idea to build it came along with the increasing air pollution in Kathmandu or must say around the world. It is a viable approach, an asset and a step towards making environment green and clean without hindering the transportation luxury. (To my defence, many countries in Europe have started riding bicycles which obviously is a great initiative but doesn't give anyone luxury and obviously is time consuming but healthy.)

**2. What was the fuel for the Trike? Or in other words, how was the Trike operated?**<br />
The Electric Trike was a three-way powered vehicle. It basically ran on three fuels: **batteries, solar power, and the hydrogen gas.**

**3. What was the chemical processes/reactions used to create the fuel for the trike?**<br />
For batteries and solar power, it was only the matter of wiring. Hydrogen gas was a major offset. Industrial production of hydrogen gas is expensive so we thought of an idea to react **Sodium hydroxide with aluminium and water which gave us Sodium Aluminate** (it is used as a cloggant in toilets and also doesn't harm the environment) and hydrogen gas.

Zinc and copper plates were used as anode and cathode respectively. Balloons were used for the use of hydrogen collection. A piece of platinum (catalyst) was used in the container to boost the reaction between **NaOH, H2O and Al.** Give proper reaction for them. The voltmeter was connected to the complete circuit then a small defelction was seen in the voltmeter **(0.6V to 0.9V)** meaning that the electricity was produced.

A fuel cell consists of two electrodes—a negative electrode (or anode) and a positive electrode (or cathode)—sandwiched around an electrolyte. A fuel, such as hydrogen, is fed to the anode, and air is fed to the cathode. **In a hydrogen fuel cell, a catalyst at the anode separates hydrogen molecules into protons and electrons, which take different paths to the cathode.** The electrons go through an external circuit, creating a flow of electricity. The protons migrate through the electrolyte to the cathode, where they unite with oxygen and the electrons to produce water and heat. Though our primary intention was to make such circuitary, we finally ended up not doing it because we didn't have enough resources and expertise to do that. This probably is our project's limitation as well.

**4. Some details about the core structure of the Trike.** <br />

We bought a **750 W and 48V motor.** Then, using a controller and accelerator I coded for the engine starter and other functions. For the engine thing, the controller or a circuit was programmed that allowed the driver to move according the instructions given by them. Accelerator changed the rotation of motor causing the vehicle to accelerate or decelerate. Everything was interconnected with wires **(motor, accelerator and controller).** Brakes were manually fit. For reduction in cost, we had re-used the brakes of bicycle.

The exteriors were designed by using metal frame and three bicycle wheels. It was kind of imbalanced structured where the designning fallacy lied because the bigger wheel was attached at the front and two small wheels at the back. To do that, the weight, length or the center of mass must be considered within the system. **Muda (a local sitting space found in Nepal) was used as a seat.** <br />

**5. Why is our trike useful for the society?**<br />

Firstly, it is environment friendly so it's a part of environment conservation. It was built with the idea of giving more within less. Meaning that it was really cheap (manufacturing cost = NRS. 35000 if solar panels not included, including solar panels can be about 60K nrs) and could be used anywhere in Nepal. **It could carry 5 people straight up that was the carrying capacity of the motor. but our vehicle was just the model so we made a place only for one person.**<br />

Could be used to carry loads in **hilly and himalayan regions** as the width of trike was way beyond a four wheeler. It was not even half the width of a four wheeler. Could be used for the **disaster management** like as in, carrying patients in narrow spaces or anything that you can think of!
